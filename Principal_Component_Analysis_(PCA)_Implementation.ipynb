        "Role in PCA\n",
        "In PCA, the covariance matrix's eigenvalues represent the variance explained by its eigenvectors. Thus, selecting the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues is akin to choosing the principal components that retain the most data variance.\n",
        "Eigenvalues and Dimensionality Reduction\n",
        "The magnitude of an eigenvalue correlates with the importance of its corresponding eigenvector (principal component) in representing the dataset's variability. By selecting a subset of eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, PCA achieves dimensionality reduction while preserving as much of the dataset's variability as possible.\n",
        "Practical Application\n",
        "1.\tStandardize the Dataset: Ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",

        "3.\tFind Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Solve the characteristic equation for the covariance matrix.\n",
        "4.\tSelect Principal Components: Choose eigenvectors (components) with the highest eigenvalues for dimensionality reduction.\n",
